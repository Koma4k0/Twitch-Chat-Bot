# üì• Installation & Usage

You are going to need to have the latest version of [node js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed. Recommended to run make sure your bot has MODERATOR in the channel you wish to use it in otherwise some features may not work!

Rename `example_config.json` to `config.json` or copy the example `config.json` below!
#
### Getting Twitch OAuth Token
- Log in to twitch with your bot account
‚ö†Ô∏è(When you create a new account, confirm the confirmation code sent to the e-mail. (You can do this with temp mail) Otherwise, oauths may not be able to send messages to chat.)
- https://twitchapps.com/tmi/ Enter this site and press the connect button.

#
### Getting your Bot's User ID / your User ID
- Go to https://www.streamweasels.com/tools/convert-twitch-username-to-user-id/ and put in each of the usernames to get the Twitch ID's, then copy them and put them in the `config.json` under `botId` and `botOwnerId`
#
### Creating a Twitch Application
- Login to twitch under your bot account and follow this link to create an app https://dev.twitch.tv/console
- Once you are there click on `Applications` on the left and the click `+ Register Your Application` on the right.
- Give your application a name, to make it simple I recommend naming it whatever you shall name your bot.
- Under `OAuth Redirect URLs` add this link as it will be important later. https://twitchtokengenerator.com
- For Category you can choose `Chat Bot` or `Other`
- Once you are done make sure to click on `Save` down at the bottom then proceed to copy and paste the `Client ID` of your application into the `config.json` file.
- Finally click on the `New Secret` button under `Client Secret` then copy and paste that into the `config.json` file.

- Enter your Twitch App Client ID and the Twitch App Client Secret
- To make things simple scroll down and click `Select All` for Available Token Scopes
- Proceed by clicking on `Generate Token!` to the right, on the following page click on `Authorize`, it will then redirect you back to the website where you will have to pass a captcha
- Double Check you generated the token for your __Bot__ account and __not your main account__
- Copy the `Access Token` and put it under `bearer_token` in `config.json`, then copy the `Refresh Token` and put it under `bearer_refresh_token` in `config.json`
